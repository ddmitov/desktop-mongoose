  
Mongoose for the Perl Executing Browser  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Mongoose for the Perl Executing Browser (PEB) is a slightly modified version of the famous Mongoose web server by Sergey Lyubka. URI handler that can stop the server is added to the code base of version 5.1. The modification is necessary for stopping the server simultaneously with the Perl Executing Browser, if this is wanted and configured in the configuration file of the browser. All changes within the source code are marked with a comment reading 'Modification for the Perl Executing Browser'. Only 'mongoose/mongoose.c' and 'mongoose/build/main.c' are modified.
